<span class="underline bold">About</span>
Seqd is a single-header library that makes the process of printing ANSI escape 
sequences much easier. This allows developers to add <span class="c46 c35">color</span> and other <span class="underline">styles</span> to 
their terminal applications.

To be able to see the styles, you will need to run the app in a 

<span class="underline bold">Single-header?</span>
Single-header means the only thing you need for the library to work is the 
<span class="underline">seqd.h</span> file and standard libraries.

This makes distributing and including the library very easy.

v v               On top of this, the header file has all the                v v
v v       documentation and information you need in order to use seqd.       v v

At the top of the file there is a clear area labelled "dependencies", where you can see the project dependencies. 

Underneath that there is a section called "docs", which includes function names, their arguments and a brief comment on what they do.

Under the docs is the preprocess options you can redefine before including SEQD in order to change the behaviour.

Then, finally, the ANSI and keyboard constants are underneath that.

<span class="underline bold">Development information</span>
Seqd was created and maintained by <span class="underline bold c33"><a href="https://github.com/ShaiyaJ">Nishi</a></span>. 

<span class="bold">The project is open to issues and pull requests.</span> However, please be patient as 
response times may be slow depending on the time of year.

New features aren't expected to be added to the <span class="underline">seqd.h</span> library. But new 
libraries may be released under the same repository.
<span class="strikethrough c31">Generally speaking, changes made will attempt not to break existing 
functionality in any way unless absolutely necessary. Updates will be purely for 
bugfixes.</span>
<div id="beta">
<span class="bold c41">The library is in beta, breaking changes are more likely to happen.</span>
<span class="bold c31">The library will exist beta after testing on Windows has been complete.</span>
